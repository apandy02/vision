# Deep Convolutional GANS 

For this project, I implemented a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network as in Radford et al 2016. I scaled up image resolution to 128x128p 

The dataset used was the BIRDS-450 image dataset. (in-progress note: the dataset is too diverse for the gan to produce high fidelity images as of now. TODO: repeat with alternate dataset)
