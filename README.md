# ComputerVision
Collection of small side projects on my DL for CV journey 

**Prerequisites to run notebooks:**

1. Python 3.7 or greater 
2. numpy 
3. PyTorch 
4. cuda enabled NVIDIA GPU (or access to one through a VM) (or extreme patience) 
5. Torchvision 

The above list is not comprehensive but lists the main building blocks for most projects in this repo. Check import lists in notebooks to find out most specifically what libraries/modules you need.
