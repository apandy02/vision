# Computer Vision

In this repository, I implement computer vision techniques and ideas that are initially new to me in notebooks. 
Then, if the notebook contains blocks of code that can be re-used for different vision tasks, I put them in files 
under the `src` directory. 

In this iterative fashion, I'm building a mini vision library built off of pure PyTorch. 

This repository goes from Lenet-5, to diffusion. 

## Notebooks

- `mnist_lenet.ipynb`: training LeNet-5 on MNIST. 
- `autoencoder.ipynb`: autoencoders. 
- `dcgan.ipynb`: Deep convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks. 
- `resnets.ipynb`: residual networks.  
- `fcn_Segmentation.ipynb`: fully convolutional networks for semantic segmentation. 
- `ddpm.ipynb`: diffusion models.
