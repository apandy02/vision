# Computer Vision Projects

This repository contains projects related to Computer Vision, completed as part of the self-guided CS231n: Deep Learning for Computer Vision course from Stanford University on YouTube. The projects in this repository represent one of many courses that the author will be taking over the next year as part of a self-guided Master's program. 

The repository currently only contains two projects related to CS231n, but the author plans to add more projects related to other courses such as Artificial Intelligence- Principles & Techniques, Natural Language Understanding with Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and others.

## Prerequisites

To run the notebooks in this repository, you will need the following:

- Python 3.7 or greater
- numpy
- PyTorch
- A CUDA enabled NVIDIA GPU (or access to one through a VM), or the patience to use a CPU
- Torchvision
- Jupyter Notebooks or Google Colab

The above list is not comprehensive, but lists the main requirements for most projects in this repository. Check the import lists in the notebooks for specific libraries and modules needed for each project.

## Projects

The projects in this repository focus on breakthrough papers in classification, detection, segmentation, and generative modeling, recreating their proposed architectures to tackle arbitrary datasets. The first five projects will act as a foundational layer for programming experience, familiarizing the author with techniques, tools, and architectures. Projects after that will be more abstract, reflecting more creativity and problem-solving experience.
