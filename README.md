# Computer Vision

In this repository, I implement computer vision techniques and ideas that are initially new to me in notebooks. 
Then, if the notebook contains blocks of code that can be re-used for different vision tasks, I put them in files 
under the `src` directory. 

In this iterative fashion, I'm building a mini vision library built off of pure PyTorch. 

This repository goes from Lenet-5, to diffusion.
